Wine is a fascinating drink dating back millennia to 6,000BC in Georgia and I doubt they found it any less obsessive than our current civilization. In time the fermented drink would make its way to the Balkans where the Greeks and Romans would celebrate the drink. The Romans believed wine to be a daily necessity and made it widely available to the classes. This is where viticulture is believed to have begun, Tuscany region. There were numerous writings within the empire on different wine types, best practices, and pruning techniques necessary to achieve yields. 
As humans explored, they took with them wine and the practices that were developed thousands of years prior. Writings of wine, their descriptions, and ranking vineyards can be traced back to Pliny the Elder and sommeliers date back to the 1300â€™s. A sommelier is an expert in wine, today being certified by a number of respected bodies world wide. The Court of Master Sommeliers was established in 1977 to improve standards and knowledge. To become a Master Sommelier you must practice for years and eventually be invited to take the exam which consists of three parts, service, theory, and tasting. 
I have wondered, if given certain descriptions of wine could one pick out the wine described. The Master Sommeliers use a deductive tasting format.

You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg){: .center-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
