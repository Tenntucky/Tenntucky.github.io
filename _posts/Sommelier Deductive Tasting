Wine is a fascinating drink dating back millennia to 6,000BC in Georgia and I doubt they found it any less 
obsessive than our current civilization. In time the fermented drink would make its way to the Balkans where 
the Greeks and Romans would celebrate the drink. The Romans believed wine to be a daily necessity and made 
it widely available to the classes. This is where viticulture is believed to have begun, Tuscany region. 
There were numerous writings within the empire on different wine types, best practices, and pruning techniques 
necessary to achieve yields. 


As humans explored, they took with them wine and the practices that were developed thousands of years prior. 
Writings of wine, their descriptions, and ranking vineyards can be traced back to Pliny the Elder and sommeliers 
date back to the 1300â€™s. A sommelier is an expert in wine, today being certified by a number of respected bodies 
world wide. The Court of Master Sommeliers was established in 1977 to improve standards and knowledge. To become 
a Master Sommelier you must practice for years and eventually be invited to take the exam which consists of three 
parts, service, theory, and tasting. 

I have wondered, if given certain descriptions of wine could one pick out the wine described. The Master Sommeliers 
use a deductive tasting format.
